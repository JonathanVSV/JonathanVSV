### Hi 👋

I am Jonathan Solórzano, a biologist interested in using remote sensing to study and monitor tropical forests 🌳🛰️. 

I am particularly keen on using multispectral, SAR, and LiDAR data with machine/deep learning algorithms to monitor land use/land cover (LULC) and aboveground biomass (AGB) changes 🤓.

I usually use R and GEE to make my analyses, and QGIS to visualize or perform other simple tasks.

You can visit this page to learn more about my research or take a look at my posts (mainly R code): https://jonathanvsv.github.io/Ppage2/
