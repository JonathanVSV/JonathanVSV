### Hi 👋

I am Jonathan Solórzano, a biologist interested in remote sensing and spatial analyses to study and monitor tropical forests 🌳🛰️. 

I am currently finishing my PhD in Geography on evaluating deep learning algorithms (CNN) to make LULC maps, as well as to detect deforestation and forest degradation 🤓.

I usually use R and GEE to make my analyses and QGIS to visualize or perform other simple tasks.

You can visit this page to know more about my research or take look at my posts (mainly R code): https://jonathanvsv.github.io/Ppage2/
